           Hi, Dori Madson here, ||~host|| of the KORG-FM afternoon show. My dog, Spot, loves to run.
The ||~trouble|| is, she was always running out of our yard into the neighbors' yards. Once, she
even ||~ran|| into the street and nearly got hit by a car! That's when I called my friends at
InvisiFence. They came right over, ||~explained|| their program, and within a couple of hours had
erected an ||~invisible|| barrier around our yard that keeps Spot on our property just like a real
fence would. Spot can now run ||~happily|| around our yard, and me and my family don't have to
||~worry|| about her running away. She'll go right to the edge of the yard, but won't go past it. The
Invisifence process was ||~smooth||, quick, and surprisingly affordable â€” much cheaper than
putting a real fence around my ||~yard|| would have been. If you're looking for an ||~effective|| way to
keep your dog on your ||~property||, call Invisifence now. They're right here in town, at 789-9876.
Or, check them out on the web at invisifence.com. Take it from me, you'll be glad you did.
